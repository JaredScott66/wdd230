            <p>The reason for white space is fairly simple. You break up groups of
                conten, so the reader is able to better break up the ideas being expressed
                and therefore comprehend better. using white space effectivly makes for a 
                clean easy to read page. 
                On this site, the princliple of white space is used in the paragraph
                to better allow ease of reading.

            <p>Hicks law is a metric by which you follow in order to limit or
                control the number of choices to be made. If there are too many 
                the user could end up with choice paralisis. Or just leaving when not quickly finding 
                what they are looking for. The screen shot shows this principle with how few 
                elements there are. you can quickly find the next step in what you are looking for.

            <p>Fitts law, is rule set that helps to determine optimal spacing and sizing between different 
                page elements. The idea that smaller elements take more focus, less space and more time
                to click. This leads to more time used and is more likely to become frustrating. 
                If an element is too large it can have similar issues.
